## 🚀 What Makes This Project Stand Out — A Reviewer's Hook

> **Skip to the code that matters.** These are the technically complex, non-trivial engineering decisions baked into Quiz Mastro.

| Engineering Feature | Technical Implementation | Key Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🤖 AI Quiz Generation** | Parses raw OpenRouter JSON defensively into Angular `FormArray` controls. | Automatically generates tiered quizzes without breaking the UI on malformed AI output. |
| **🔄 Lifecycle State Machine** | Quizzes transition states (`published → grading → finished`) via automatic time-based evaluation. | Ensures consistent exam states across refreshes and LocalStorage revivals. |
| **🔗 Connection-Scoped Visibility**| Cross-references a `student ↔ teacher` graph before returning filtered quiz lists. | Creates a secure, real-time enrollment model without a backend database. |
| **📊 Per-Student Grading Engine** | Auto-grades MCQs and supports per-question manual scoring for written responses. | Prevents quiz completion until all enrolled students are accurately evaluated. |
| **⏳ Time-Locked Exam** | Computes remaining time mid-session with Web Audio warnings and an `autoSubmit` trigger. | Enforces strict exam durations autonomously without teacher intervention. |
| **🛡️ Isolated Layout Shells** | Mounts three independent layout shells protected by role-level `authGuard` data checks. | Guarantees complete route and data isolation between Admins, Teachers, and Students. |

> **⚠️ AI Feature Note (Live Demo):** The AI Quiz Generation feature in the live demo utilizes a shared OpenRouter API key. Due to public rate limits, AI generation may occasionally be restricted. For uninterrupted access and production deployment, the platform is designed with a "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) architecture. See the installation steps to run it locally with your own free key.
## 
✨ Key Features

### 🤖 1. AI-Assisted Quiz Builder
- **OpenRouter AI Integration**: Teachers can auto-generate full quizzes by specifying a topic, description, and exact question counts broken down by type (MCQ / Written) and difficulty (Easy / Medium / Hard) — each with a custom point value.
- **Resilient JSON Parsing**: The AI response pipeline defensively strips markdown code fences and extracts valid JSON arrays before injecting them into Angular's reactive `FormArray`, ensuring no broken form states from malformed AI output.

### 🛠️ 2. Three-Tier Role Architecture & Route Isolation
- **Super Admin, Teacher, Student**: Three independent layout shells and navigation trees, each mounted as a separate router outlet group guarded by `authGuard` with role-level data checking.
- **Quiz Guard**: A dedicated `QuizGuard` enforces context — students can only enter `attempt-quiz` when the quiz status is `active`, and teachers can only access `grading-quiz` when status is `grading`. Direct URL access is blocked at the guard level.

### 📋 3. Full Quiz Lifecycle Management
- **Multi-Phase State Machine**: Quizzes progress through `unpublished → published → grading → finished` automatically. The teacher dashboard polls quiz statuses every 30 seconds, and student-facing statuses (`scheduled`, `active`, `expired`) are computed in real-time from start time and duration.
- **Manual & AI Quiz Creation**: Teachers can build quizzes manually question-by-question via a reactive `FormArray`-backed builder, or generate an entire question set through the AI dialog — both paths feed into the same quiz model.

### 🎯 4. Timed Student Examination Interface
- **Countdown Timer with Audio**: The exam interface calculates remaining time from the quiz's scheduled `startTime`, plays a **clock-ticking audio cue** in the final 8 seconds, and automatically submits the exam when time expires.
- **Progressive Answer Persistence**: Each answer selection immediately calls `updateStudentAnswerForStudent()`, persisting partial answers to LocalStorage in real-time — protecting against accidental navigation or page refresh.
- **Question Navigation Panel**: Students can jump directly to any question by index, with answered/unanswered visual indicators per question slot.

### 📊 5. Per-Student Grading Engine
- **MCQ Auto-Grading**: The grading view automatically detects correct MCQ answers by comparing the student's submitted option ID against the stored `correctAnswer` and awards full points.
- **Written Question Manual Scoring**: Teachers can assign custom scores to written responses with a per-question input. Manual scores take precedence over any auto-computed values.
- **Grade Completion Gate**: A quiz only transitions to `finished` after all connected students have been reviewed — enforced by `checkQuizCompletionStatus()` which compares submitted vs. graded student counts.

### 🔗 6. Student–Teacher Connection Graph
- **Enrollment Model**: Students are only shown quizzes from teachers they are connected to. The `ConnectionService` maintains a persistent graph in LocalStorage and exposes filtered query methods (`getConnectionsByStudent`, `getConnectionsByTeacher`).
- **Admin Relationship Map**: The Super Admin portal renders a computed signal-based relationship visualizer (`RelashionMapComponent`) showing which students are enrolled under which teachers, with live search filtering.

### 🔍 7. Global Cross-Entity Search (Super Admin)
- **Multi-Type Search Engine**: The `SearchService` queries students, teachers, connections, and navigation pages in a single pass, returning a unified result set with **inline term highlighting** applied via regex injection into both title and description fields.
- **Real-Time Term Highlight**: Matched substrings are wrapped in `<mark>` tags for immediate visual feedback as the admin types.

### 🔒 8. Zod-Validated Authentication
- **Schema-First Login**: The sign-in form uses **Zod** to validate credentials before submission, surfacing field-level error messages reactively as the user types and suppressing duplicate errors intelligently.
- **Three-Path Role Routing**: On successful login, `AuthService` resolves the user against the student or teacher registry (or the hardcoded super admin), persists the session to LocalStorage, and routes to the correct role portal automatically.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

Quiz Mastro is structured around a modular, reactive Angular 20 architecture with three isolated portal shells:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Client[Angular 20 Standalone App] -->|Route Navigation| Router[Angular Router]
    Router -->|Unauthenticated| Public[Landing Page & Sign-In / Zod Validation]
    Router -->|role: super| AdminView[Super Admin Portal - LayoutComponent]
    Router -->|role: teacher| TeacherView[Teacher Portal - LayoutTeacherComponent]
    Router -->|role: student| StudentView[Student Portal - LayoutStudentComponent]

    Public -->|AuthService.login| Auth[AuthService / LocalStorage Session]
    Auth -->|Role resolved| Router

    TeacherView -->|QuizDataService BehaviorSubject| QuizState[Quiz State Engine]
    StudentView -->|Connection-scoped filter| QuizState
    QuizState -->|Status machine evaluation| StatusEngine[evaluateQuizStatus / checkAllQuizStatuses]
    QuizState -->|Per-student submissions map| GradingEngine[gradeQuizForStudent / checkQuizCompletionStatus]

    TeacherView -->|OpenRouter HTTP POST| AIService[AiService / AI Quiz Generation]
    AIService -->|JSON parse pipeline| QuizFormArray[ReactiveForm FormArray injection]

    AdminView -->|SearchService multi-type query| SearchEngine[Global Search - Students / Teachers / Connections]
    AdminView -->|Computed signals| RelationMap[RelashionMapComponent - Enrollment Graph]
```

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **Standalone Components**: Every component is declared as standalone, enabling fine-grained lazy loading and eliminating NgModule boilerplate entirely.
- **BehaviorSubject-Driven State**: `QuizDataService` exposes `quizzes$` as a `BehaviorSubject`, allowing the teacher dashboard to reactively subscribe and re-render on any quiz state mutation without manual change detection.
- **Computed Signals in Admin**: The relationship map uses Angular 20's `computed()` signals to derive the filtered student–teacher graph reactively from `search()` signal input — no manual subscription management.
- **Spartan-ng / Helm**: Headless UI primitives (Brain layer) combined with Helm-styled components give full accessibility compliance with zero custom dialog or select implementations.

### 3. Configure AI Quiz Generation (Bring Your Own Key)
To prevent API rate-limiting in production and local development, Quiz Mastro requires you to supply your own OpenRouter API key. 

Because Quiz Mastro uses a secure Vercel Serverless Function (`api/ai.ts`), your API key is never exposed to the frontend.

**For Vercel Deployment:**
Go to your Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables and add:
- **Name:** `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- **Value:** `sk-or-v1-YOUR_KEY_HERE`

**For Local Development:**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:
```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-YOUR_KEY_HERE
```
### 4. Start the Development Server
```bash
ng serve
```
> The application will start immediately. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

### 5. Build for Production
```bash
ng build
```
> This will compile the Angular application using the high-performance esbuild pipeline, producing optimized static artifacts in the `dist/` directory.

### 6. Running Unit Tests
```bash
ng test
```
